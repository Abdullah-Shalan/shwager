# Explanation of each entity in the system

## 1. `Hr` (Human Resources)

### What it does:

Represents the HR user ‚Äî the person managing job positions and overseeing the onboarding process.

### Contribution:

* Creates jobs and their associated onboarding tasks.
* Invites candidates and assigns them to jobs.
* Monitors each candidate‚Äôs progress through their onboarding checklist.

### Why it's needed:

Without an HR actor, there‚Äôs no source of task creation, job posting, or candidate assignment ‚Äî they‚Äôre the driver of the onboarding process.

---

## 2. `Job`

### What it does:

Represents a job opening or position, such as ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù or ‚ÄúSales Intern‚Äù.

### Contribution:

* Serves as the anchor point for onboarding ‚Äî each job has a custom set of onboarding tasks.
* Candidates are assigned to specific jobs (which determine what tasks they must complete).

### Why it's needed:

Different jobs often have different onboarding requirements (e.g. legal, training, equipment setup). This entity makes onboarding customizable per role.

---

## 3. `Candidate`

### What it does:

Represents a person going through onboarding for a job.

### Contribution:

* Receives onboarding tasks via their assigned job.
* Marks their tasks as completed (progress tracking).
* Is linked to HR through the job they are assigned to.

### Why it's needed:

They are the core participant in the onboarding process ‚Äî the system revolves around helping candidates complete their setup to join the company.

---

## 4. `JopTask`

### What it does:

Represents a task required for onboarding, such as:

* ‚ÄúUpload National ID‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSign NDA‚Äù
* ‚ÄúComplete security training‚Äù

Each task belongs to a specific `Job`.

### Contribution:

* Defines the requirements that candidates must complete to be considered fully onboarded.
* Is reused across multiple candidates applying for the same job.

### Why it's needed:

Formalizes onboarding into structured steps ‚Äî no ambiguity, everything is trackable and clear.

---

## 5. `CandidateTask`

### What it does:

A link between a candidate and an onboarding task. Tracks:

* Whether a candidate has started/completed a specific task
* When they finished it
* What status it‚Äôs in (e.g. NotStarted, InProgress, Completed)

### Contribution:

* Provides individual task tracking for each candidate.
* Allows HR to view granular progress (who is stuck, who is done).

### Why it's needed:

Without this, you couldn't track progress at a per-candidate level ‚Äî it adds personalization and traceability to the process.

---

## 6. `TaskStatus` (Enum)

### What it does:

Defines allowed states of a task:

* NotStarted
* InProgress
* Completed

### Contribution:

* Standardizes how the system understands progress.
* Used in reporting and conditional logic (e.g. notify HR when all tasks are completed).

### Why it's needed:

Helps track lifecycle of each task ‚Äî it's essential for dashboards, reminders, and analytics.
